About
===

The Tomsson Archive provides digital copies of the [SLM Stockholm](https://slmstockholm.se/en/) member’s magazine Tomsson, printed between 1981 and 2006. The magazine and newsletter was subsequently, and still is to this day, published digitally. By making past issues accessible the archive promotes the legacy of Stockholm Leather subculture.

The archive is maintained by the [Stockholm Leather History](https://www.instagram.com/stockholm.leather.history/) project.

Do you possess as-of-yet un-digitized issues of Tomsson or other materials that might interest the Stockholm Leather History project? Please reach out to us! We are especially interested in missing issues of Tomsson and copies of Mister SM and Toy by Revolt Förlag.
